## About the Project

- My framework is a TDD framework.
- Dependency was installed into the pom.xml file
- I built my framework using Java Programming Language.
- I used maven as a build automation tool for my java project.
- I used Cucumber-Junit.

- I also use tags for tests that I want to run.
- I can enter inputs from the console and run tests from VendingMachineTest class.
